 * Problem: Find a Safe Walk Through a Grid
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-safe-walk-through-a-grid/
 * Language: cpp
 * Topics: Array, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Matrix, Shortest Path
 * 
 * ── Problem ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid and an integer health .
 * You start on the upper-left corner (0, 0) and would like to get to the lower-right corner (m - 1, n - 1) .
 * You can move up, down, left, or right from one cell to another adjacent cell as long as your health remains positive .
 * Cells (i, j) with grid[i][j] = 1 are considered unsafe and reduce your health by 1.
 * Return true if you can reach the final cell with a health value of 1 or more, and false otherwise.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0]], health = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 * The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,1],[0,0,1,0,1,0]], health = 3
 * Output: false
 * Explanation:
 * A minimum of 4 health points is needed to reach the final cell safely.
 * Example 3:
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]], health = 5
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 * The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.
 * Any path that does not go through the cell (1, 1) is unsafe since your health will drop to 0 when reaching the final cell.
 * Constraints:
 * • m == grid.length
 * • n == grid[i].length
 * • 1 <= m, n <= 50
 * • 2 <= m * n
 * • 1 <= health <= m + n
 * • grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
 * 
 * ── Hints ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Hint 1: Use 01 BFS.
