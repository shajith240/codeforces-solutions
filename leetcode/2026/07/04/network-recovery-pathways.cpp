 * ── Problem ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * You are given a directed acyclic graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n &minus; 1 . This is represented by a 2D array edges of length m , where edges[i] = [u i , v i , cost i ] indicates a one‑way communication from node u i to node v i with a recovery cost of cost i .
 * Some nodes may be offline. You are given a boolean array online where online[i] = true means node i is online. Nodes 0 and n &minus; 1 are always online.
 * A path from 0 to n &minus; 1 is valid if:
 * • All intermediate nodes on the path are online.
 * The total recovery cost of all edges on the path does not exceed k .
 * For each valid path, define its score as the minimum edge‑cost along that path.
 * Return the maximum path score (i.e., the largest minimum -edge cost) among all valid paths. If no valid path exists, return -1.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: edges = [[0,1,5],[1,3,10],[0,2,3],[2,3,4]], online = [true,true,true,true], k = 10
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * The graph has two possible routes from node 0 to node 3:
 * Path 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 3
 * Total cost = 5 + 10 = 15 , which exceeds k ( 15 > 10 ), so this path is invalid.
 * Path 0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3
 * Total cost = 3 + 4 = 7 <= k , so this path is valid.
 * The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(3, 4) = 3 .
 * There are no other valid paths. Hence, the maximum among all valid path‐scores is 3.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: edges = [[0,1,7],[1,4,5],[0,2,6],[2,3,6],[3,4,2],[2,4,6]], online = [true,true,true,false,true], k = 12
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * Node 3 is offline, so any path passing through 3 is invalid.
 * Consider the remaining routes from 0 to 4:
 * Path 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 4
 * Total cost = 7 + 5 = 12 <= k , so this path is valid.
 * The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(7, 5) = 5 .
 * Path 0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 4
 * Node 3 is offline, so this path is invalid regardless of cost.
 * Path 0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 4
 * Total cost = 6 + 6 = 12 <= k , so this path is valid.
 * The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(6, 6) = 6 .
 * Among the two valid paths, their scores are 5 and 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.
 * Constraints:
 * n == online.length
 * 2 <= n <= 5 * 10 4
 * 0 <= m == edges.length <= min(10 5 , n * (n - 1) / 2)
 * edges[i] = [u i , v i , cost i ]
 * 0 <= u i , v i < n
 * u i != v i
 * 0 <= cost i <= 10 9
 * 0 <= k <= 5 * 10 13
 * online[i] is either true or false , and both online[0] and online[n &minus; 1] are true .
 * The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
 * 
 * ── Hints ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Hint 1: Use binary search on ans .
 * Hint 2: Check if a particular ans is possible by including only the edges with weights ≥ mid (the current binary‐search pivot).
 * Hint 3: Implement the check function using either Dijkstra or DP (via topological sorting, since the graph is a DAG).
