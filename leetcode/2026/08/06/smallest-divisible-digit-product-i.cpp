/*
 * Problem: Smallest Divisible Digit Product I
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-divisible-digit-product-i/
 * Language: cpp
 * Topics: Math, Enumeration
 * 
 * ── Problem ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * You are given two integers n and t . Return the smallest number greater than or equal to n such that the product of its digits is divisible by t .
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 10, t = 2
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation:
 * The digit product of 10 is 0, which is divisible by 2, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that satisfies the condition.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 15, t = 3
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation:
 * The digit product of 16 is 6, which is divisible by 3, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 15 that satisfies the condition.
 * Constraints:
 * • 1 <= n <= 100
 * • 1 <= t <= 10
 * 
 * ── Hints ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Hint 1: You have to check at most 10 numbers.
 * Hint 2: Apply a brute-force approach by checking each possible number.
 *
